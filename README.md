## The Boston House Price Dataset Analysis

This repository contains and analysis of the Boston House Price dataset. The report is created using a jupyter notebook. 

#### The analysis consists of -

   -  Explanation and exploration of the boston house price dataset 
   -  Inferential Statistics
   -  Predictive linear regression modelling
   -  Predictive modelling using neural networks
   -  Comparison of the predict models results

#### Python Packages
The following packages are used in this report and can all be downloaded as part of the anaconda package.

    Numpy - This is used to conduct statistical analysis on the dataset
    Pandas - This is used to put the imported data into dataframes
    Matplotlib - This pakage is used to generate graphs, to interpret the data and grapically display the results
    SciKit - This package is used to conduct linear regression predictive analysis
    Keras - This package is used to generate neural networks for predictive modelling

#### Explanation and Exploration 
This section outlines what is contained in the dataset. The data is cleaned and plotted in order to get an understanding of the features within the dataset.

#### Inferential Statistics 
This section contains an analysis on whether there is a significant difference in median house prices
between houses that are along the Charles river and those that arenâ€™t.

#### Predictive linear regression modelling
This section generates predictive linear regression models inorder to predict the median house prices. Two techniques are compared. These consist of a multiple linear regression, using both manual feature elimination and cross validated recursive feature elimination.

#### Predictive modelling using neural networks
This section generates a predictive model, using the Keras package, to generate neural networks inorder to predict the median house prices. 

#### Comparison of the predict models results
This section compares the results of the of the predition models performance, in predicting the median house values.

#### How to download Anaconda
All of the python packages used in this analysis can be download from the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/?gclid=CjwKCAiAis3vBRBdEiwAHXB29CoFXA_ss1xhYpKUCLsw4XoaBmen7SUkiW9Nv36T8fUjvIOMK8hakBoCYjAQAvD_BwE).

#### How to run the Jupyter Notebook
In order to run this notebook you will need to install jupyter notebooks.Here is the installation documentation for the
[Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
