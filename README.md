## The Boston House Price Dataset Analysis

This repository contains and analysis of the Boston House Price dataset. The report is created using a jupyter notebook. 

#### Jupyter Notebook Contents 

   1. Explanation and exploration of the boston house price dataset 
   2. Inferential Statistics
   3. Predictive linear regression modelling
   4. Predictive modelling using neural networks
   5. Comparison of the predictive models results

#### Python Packages
The following packages are used in this report and can all be downloaded as part of the anaconda package.

   -  Numpy - This is used to conduct statistical analysis on the dataset
   -  Pandas - This is used to put the imported data into dataframes
   -  Matplotlib/Seaborn - These pakages were used to generate graphs, to interpret the data and grapically display the results
   -  SciKit - This package is used to conduct linear regression predictive analysis
   -  Keras - This package is used to generate neural networks for predictive modelling

#### 1.  Explanation and Exploration 
This section outlines what is contained in the dataset. The data is cleaned and plotted in order to get an understanding of the features within the dataset.

#### 2.  Inferential Statistics 
This section contains an analysis on whether there is a significant difference in median house prices
between houses that are along the Charles river and those that arenâ€™t.

#### 3. Predictive linear regression modelling
This section generates predictive linear regression models inorder to predict the median house prices. Two techniques are compared. These consist of a multiple linear regression, using both manual feature elimination and cross validated recursive feature elimination.

#### 4.  Predictive modelling using neural networks
This section generates a predictive model, using the Keras package, to generate neural networks inorder to predict the median house prices. 

#### 5.  Comparison of the predictive models results
This section compares the results of the of the predition models performance, in predicting the median house values.

#### How to download Anaconda
All of the python packages used in this analysis can be download from the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/?gclid=CjwKCAiAis3vBRBdEiwAHXB29CoFXA_ss1xhYpKUCLsw4XoaBmen7SUkiW9Nv36T8fUjvIOMK8hakBoCYjAQAvD_BwE).

#### How to run the Jupyter Notebook
